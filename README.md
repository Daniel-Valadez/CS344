# CS344
These are some assignments that I have worked on during my time in CS344 (Operating Systems I) at Oregon State University.

Each one of these folders contains a whole assignment from OS1. You can run these locally if you would like to, but that 
is not the general recommendation due to the nature of these assignments forking processes, interprcoess communication, etc etc.
